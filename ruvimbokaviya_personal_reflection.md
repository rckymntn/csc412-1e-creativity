This reflection is presented as part of the Fall 2023 CSC 412
Computing for Cognitive Augmentation Course - Assignment 3. I thank Miguel
Nacenta, and Sarina Kashanj for your continued support, assistance and
understanding during the course.

This assignment has been an enjoyable experience. I've worked on and off with Obsidian over the years and having the chance to use the platform for an assignment was exciting. It's unique in the Computer Science program to use tools that I integrate into my daily life (and would use regardless of an assignment). It is interesting to think of Obsidian as an extension of the course material, a tool for expanding my capabilities in a fun way.

Collaboration with Spencer and Logan has been a great experience. Both were willing to listen and come up with ideas. We decided to use Github for syncing our vault. This was a novel pairing for me and came with some frustration but it worked out well in the end. Unfortunately one of our earlier teammates, Kartikye Kashyap ran into some personal issues during the project completion. If we could do anything differently, it would be figuring out what was going on earlier by contacting Miguel. We tried many times to contact Kartikye privately, and it was a difficult decision to bring this to Miguel's attention.
