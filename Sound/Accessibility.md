Creative audio techniques can be implemented from the beginning of a project to create accessible video games. 

An example that is less scholarly, but more practical is [Dowino's A Blind Legend (2016).](https://store.steampowered.com/app/437530/A_Blind_Legend/) Granted, this is more of a creative application of technological advances than technological advance increasing creativity. However, without our current advances in sound technology, would this game or others like it be possible? 

This example of accessibility achieves cognitive augmentation by focusing solely on sound. While other games will have a mix of audio and visual components, this game relies entirely on a person's sense of sound. As such, even if a person's sense of sight is impaired, they can use their other senses to engage in a popular hobby.
