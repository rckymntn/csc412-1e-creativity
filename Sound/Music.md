## Adaptive Music 

Traditionally, music for video games are separated into discrete tracks that play during predefined conditions. There would be no meshing between songs (except for a crossfade, perhaps) and variations of tracks would still be their own discrete tracks. With adaptive music, however, the music can add or subtract elements on-the-fly in response to the current state of the game. The same track could play completely differently in regards to instruments, tempo, etc. given different game states. Axel Berndt aptly describes adaptive music as "establish\[ing] a form of live-generated musical collage that reflects the events in the interactive scene." (Adaptive game scoring with ambient music, 2019)

Adaptive music is an underexplored way in which creativity in the video game design process can be augmented. By having music be able to react and mesh with itself and other tracks, it creates new avenues in which to express the music's intent. Additionally, adaptive music could be used for cognitive augmentation by providing subtle feedback to the user by responding to their actions or events in the game. 

## Music in General 

Music, reactive or not, can also be used to emphasize certain narrative elements by setting a certain tone, providing rhythm, or some other auditory technique to draw the player's attention or emotion in a certain direction. As such, music is often involved early in the game development process and may be a crucial part of [[Using Technology To Enhance Story]].

This relates to cognitive augmentation by virtue of encoding information or feedback to the player in music that dynamically responds to their actions. Instead of presenting and processing that information visually, the player hears the information and processes it through their hearing.
