Omnidirectional sound is sound which can be perceived and interpreted as originating from a specific point in space. For example, hearing footsteps run down a hallway one floor up from you. Typically, creating realistic sounding audio originating at a different point on the vertical axis has been a pain point in several games. As such, the vertical component of omnidirectional sound will often go through several iterations and tweaks to achieve an accurate result. 

This is an example of cognitive augmentation because being able to accurately discern the origin of a sound can give a player a competitive advantage in a game by providing information that is otherwise unobservable. In other words, this technology allows for players to digest a new type of information to use to their advantage in a game, if they are able to properly understand it. 

Some popular examples of games with a heavy emphasis on omnidirectional sound done well would be:
- *Hunt: Showdown*, Crytek (2018)
- *Dark and Darker*, IronMace Studios (2023)
- *Rainbow Six: Siege*, Ubisoft (2015)
These games will use omnidirectional sound [[Effects]] to provide information to the player. For example, in *Hunt: Showdown*, if you hear crows cawing and flying away in the distance, you can be sure there was a team there. If you can accurately pinpoint where the noise came from, you can then find the team. These games also make use footsteps to identify player positions when in close proximity. 

These omnidirectional sound effects could augment creativity by providing players a new source of information from which to formulate strategies. Continuing with the above crow noises example from *Hunt: Showdown*, players do not have to see each other to be made aware of their presence and can opt to try and ambush the other group or they could try to avoid the other group's suspected area.
