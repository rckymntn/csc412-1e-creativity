Sound which can be perceived and interpreted as originating from a specific point in space. For example, hearing footsteps run down a hallway one floor up from you. Typically, creating realistic sounding audio originating at a different point on the vertical axis has been a pain point in several games. As such, the vertical component of omnidirectional sound will often go through several iterations and tweaks to achieve an accurate result. 

This is an example of cognitive augmentation because being able to accurately discern the origin of a sound can give a player a competitive advantage in a game by providing information that is otherwise unobservable. In other words, this technology allows for players to digest a new type of information to use to their advantage in a game, if they are able to properly understand it. 

Some popular examples of games with a heavy emphasis on omnidirectional sound done well would be:
- Escape From Tarkov, Battlestate Games 
- Hunt: Showdown, Crytek
- Dark and Darker, IronMace Studios
- Rainbow Six: Siege, Ubisoft
