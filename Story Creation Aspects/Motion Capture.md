# What is Motion Capture?

Motion capture technology is the pipeline of technologies that allow for a videogame to use the real movements of an actor for the character animations in the video game. There are two types of motion capture needed for video game animations: Body movement and facial movement. For capturing body movement, the actors move in the center of several cameras (Figure 1) while wearing a suit with specific reflective markers that will be translated into a 3d rendering in a design software (Figure 2). For capturing facial expressions, the actor wears a special helmet mounted camera (HMC) that records their face from multiple angles while adding pivot points to the recording (Figure 3). The animators then use design software like Autodesk Maya to animate those pivot points.
