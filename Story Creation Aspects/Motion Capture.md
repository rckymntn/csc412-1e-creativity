# What is Motion Capture?

Motion capture technology is the pipeline of technologies that allow for a videogame to use the real movements of an actor for the character animations in the video game. There are two types of motion capture needed for video game animations: Body movement and facial movement. For capturing body movement, the actors move in the center of 4 cameras while wearing a suit with specific 'capture points' that will be translated into a 3d rendering in a design software. For capturing facial expressions, the actor wears a special helmet mounted camera (HMC) that records their face from multiple angles while adding pivot points to the recording. The animators then use design software to animate those pivot points.
