# What is Physically Based Rendering?

Physically Based Rendering (PBR) is "more of a concept than a strict set of rules."$^1$ 


Basic idea: Layering textures over meshes allow people who are not programmers to easily design the environment. This allows the designers to have a higher degree of control over the environmental storytelling for the video game. I.E. creating worn out and decrepit textures for a post-apocalyptic game. 




Possible Quotes:
"With technological advancements and emerging new tools, the methods for constructing video game environments go through changes. As the methods change with new tools at artists’ disposal, the approach towards spatial design and environmental storytelling also changes."$^2$
