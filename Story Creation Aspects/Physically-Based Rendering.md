# What is Physically Based Rendering?

Physically Based Rendering (PBR) is "more of a concept than a strict set of rules."$^1$ PBR is the process of creating textures that look realistic by using scalable characteristics such as color, opacity, blend, albedo, reflectivity, gloss, and more.$^3$ These textures are then layered over a mesh, a collection of vertices, edges, and faces that act as the foundation of a model, to create the game environment and characters.
