Motion Capture technology has greatly enhanced the ability for characters in video games to have realistic emotional expressions and behaviors. This has allowed for writers more freedom to design emotional and dramatic stories that wouldn't have as much of an impact without it. 

Motion Capture allows for writers to create stories based on realism and subtlety in the character's acting instead of solely on the mechanics of the gameplay.
