## Introduction
___

Video games exist at the intersection of technology and creativity, art and science, interactivity, interconnectivity and the quest to conquer worlds other than our own. New World Encyclopedia defines a video game as "...a **game** that involves the interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device..." [1]. By their very nature, it is impossible to separate video games from the technology that is used to create them, distribute them, and the platforms that allow us to play them.

This vault explores the video game creation process in particular, and examines how cognitive augmentation is used to enhance creativity across the several aspects of video game creation - video game story, video game sound and video game visuals. Creativity is a necessary and fundamental characteristic in video game development and advances in technology can further augment designers' creative process or allow for better creative expression.
