# Introduction to Story Design in Video Games
____
Interactive story-telling is at the heart of many games. "Unlike other storytelling mediums, video games grant players agency, allowing them to influence the narrative’s direction."$^1$ From the simple story of a plumber trying to rescue a princess, to massive narratives with complex consequences for every decision. However, the latter is only possible because of the technological augmentation of the story design process. " Whether it's allowing for emotional storytelling with motion capture technology, subtle and intricate environmental storytelling with physically-based rendering, or emergent story design with procedurally generated content. One thing is for sure, the ability to create unique and compelling interactive stories is at an all time high.
# Key Technologies for Augmenting Story Design
____
### [[Motion Capture]]
A key aspect of storytelling is being able to show emotion in your characters. Without it, stories become limited and two dimensional. [[Motion Capture]] technology allows the game's creator to be as creative as they want with their characters movements and expressions without being limited by their ability to code. Consequently, creative problems that require subtlety and realism become no problem for the augmented ability of the game's creator.
### [[Physically-Based Rendering]]
Stories don't happen in a vacuum, they happen in environments. A dark and stormy night, a sunny island, a post-apocalyptic wasteland. "As a result, video game environments have evolved into more than being just a platform that hosts the player interaction. They have become an important outlet for artistic creativity and an important part of visual storytelling"$^{2}$ 
### [[Procedural Content Generation]]
