# Introduction
___

Video games exist at the intersection of technology and creativity, art and science, interactivity, interconnectivity and the quest to conquer worlds other than our own. New World Encyclopedia defines a video game as "...a **game** that involves the interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device..." [1]. By their very nature, it is impossible to separate video games from the technology that is used to create them, distribute them, and the platforms that allow us to play them.

This vault explores the video game creation process in particular, and examines how cognitive augmentation is used to enhance creativity across the several aspects of video game creation - video game story, video game sound and video game visuals. Creativity is a necessary and fundamental characteristic in video game development and advances in technology can further augment designers' creative process or allow for better creative expression. 

A definition of cognitive augmentation is important for this vault. This is clarified below.

**Cognitive Augmentation**

To synthesize a relevant definition for this vault, we look at Cinel et al.'s definition of cognitive enhancement: "...by _cognitive enhancement_ we mean the improvement of the processes of acquiring/generating knowledge and understanding the world around us. Such processes encompass attention, the formation of knowledge, memory, judgement and evaluation, reasoning and computation, problem solving and decision making, as well as the comprehension and production of language [2] and Fulbright's characterization of cognitive systems: "Cognitive systems, whether or not they are human or artificial, process and transform information" [3]. We also incorporate a definition of cognitive computing: "Cognitive computing refers to technology platforms influenced by cognitive science to simulate the human thought process" [4]. Lastly, in order to encompass creativity (a recognized aspect of cognition [5]) we arrive at a final definition.

Cognitive Augmentation refers to the processes (human or technological) influenced by cognitive science to simulate and improve the human thought process, and process and transform information. Cognitive Augmentation encompasses technologies that improve cognitive processes such as creativity, attention, the formation of knowledge, memory, judgement and evaluation, reasoning and computation, problem solving and decision making, as well as the comprehension and production of language [2, 3, 4].

# Overview of the Video Game Creation Process
___

This vault will explore three aspects of the video game creation process:

- [[Cognitive Augmentation To Enhance Story Design]]
- [[Cognitive Augmentation, Creativity, and Sound]]
- [[Cognitive Augmentation, Creativity and Enhancing Video Game Visuals]]
# Key Terms and Definitions
--- 
This section provides definitions for key terms that will be used throughout this vault.

- **_Video Game_**: A game that involves the interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device. [1]

- **_Cognitive Augmentation_**: The processes (human or technological) influenced by cognitive science to simulate and improve the human thought process, and process and transform information. Cognitive Augmentation encompasses technologies that improve cognitive processes such as creativity, attention, the formation of knowledge, memory, judgement and evaluation, reasoning and computation, problem solving and decision making, as well as the comprehension and production of language. [2, 3, 4]
