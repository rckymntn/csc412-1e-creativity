What is CGI?

"The principle behind computer-generated imagery (CGI) is very simple: dedicated computer tools simulate a three-dimensional world where objects and eventually whole scenes are modeled from the combination/manipulation of geometric primitives (cubes, spheres, etc.)...With the proper resources, CGI has reached near-cinematographic visual realism.""
