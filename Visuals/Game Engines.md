Game engines are platforms that provide the tools required to create and run video games. They serve as the foundation of game development, offering a range of features that aid video game designers with the process of video game creation. Kumar explains: "A game engine provides easy-to-use tools for physics input, real-time rendering, scripting, dynamics, collision detection, artificial intelligence, and more without the need for too much programming from scratch" [1]. Game engines are responsible for rendering the visual elements of a game. They use advanced rendering techniques to create lifelike environments, characters, and special effects. This includes rendering 2D or 3D graphics and managing lighting and shadows.
