# Introduction to Video Game Visuals and Technology
____
In the digital age, visual design in video games has become an art form in itself. From realistic graphics and immersive environments, to intricate character design and stunning special effects, technology has become an indispensable tool for game developers and artists, enabling them to push the boundaries of creativity and deliver captivating, visually stunning experiences to players around the world. The intersection of technology and creativity is reshaping the landscape of video game visuals and setting new standards for immersive, interactive storytelling.

Because of their digital nature, video games have required the union of technology and creativity from their conception. Early video game graphics, such as those featured in the game _Computer Space_ (1971) seemed limited by their technology. Bushnell and Dabney, the designers of the game found "...difficulties with their planned design: the computer was not powerful enough to run multiple simultaneous games and refresh the monitors as fast as was needed to make the games playable...the pair attempted to reduce the load on the computer by replacing subroutines [in the game code] such as displaying the background stars—with specialized hardware, but it proved insufficient" [1]. This is no longer the case in the modern age. Today, technology and cognitive augmentation has become a tool used to achieve visual feats that could only be considered science fiction in the days of Computer Space.
